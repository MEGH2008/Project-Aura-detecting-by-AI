## 1.1 Intro

In accelerator physics, beam halos are often regarded as unwanted side effects — low-density peripheral particles that deviate from the dense beam core, potentially damaging equipment or polluting measurements. However, these halos are not meaningless. Their shape and intensity often encode subtle information about the beam's composition, momentum, stability, and its interaction with materials along the beamline.

## 1.2 Research Focus

Our primary research question:

> **Can artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques extract useful diagnostic information from beam halos?**

In simple terms, we seek to study beam halos — typically considered noise — and explore whether machine learning models can reveal hidden patterns related to beam stability, composition, and structure.  

This interdisciplinary approach connects modern accelerator science with the transformative power of AI.
